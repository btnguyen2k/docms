DO CMS is a Content Management System targeting developers as its users. Instead of relying on a GUI to create, publish and update website content, these operations are done via developer-friendly tools and flow: Git and CI/CD.

## Highlighted features

-  **Markdown** is a simple yet powerful markup language for creating formatted text. DO CMS supports [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/) as well as extensions such as Mathematical and Chemical formulas.

- **No Database** - website content is rendered from static data - which is Markdown text. Hence DO CMS needs no database to run, and it is blazing fast.

- **Developer Friendly** - authoring website content is as similar as pushing code, making pull requests, builds, packages and deploying.

- **Fulltext Search** - website content is fulltext indexed and searchable.

- **Multi-languages** - multi-language website content is support, switching languages is on-the-fly.
